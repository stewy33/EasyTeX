# EasyTeX - Hackital 2017

This was our ([Jason](https://github.com/codethejason),
[Sri](https://github.com/spp2010), [Alisha](https://github.com/pikachu1995)
project at Hackital 2017 at George Washington University. We won 3rd place
overall for EasyTeX. 

EasyTeX is a browser-based math note-taking app leveraging the power of LaTeX
and Markdown. The traditional issue with both LaTeX and Markdown is that what
you see, as you are typing is not what you get. The source code has to be
compiled into a more human-readable format.

When I was taking notes in my math class, I noticed that LaTeX was distracting
and hard to use. The syntax does not look like real math, and that makes it
hard to both comprehend what you are typing, and avoid syntax errros at the
same time, especially in a fast-paced lecture. A lot of people enjoy the
convenience and organization of digital notes, but LaTeX is distracting, and a
visual editor like Word is impractical with its maze of menus.

EasyTeX is different form other onlin editors like ShareLaTeX or StackEdit
because it merges the code view and rendered view onto the same document. As
you type, EasyTeX renders your math into a visual format, and when you
backspace into it, EasyTeX turns the rendered math back into source text. That
means you can see what you get, but also take advantage of the power of LaTeX
and Markdown.

EasyTeX is currently in a very broken state, and worked just well enough to
last through the short demos at Hackital. I haven't had the time to continue
this project since, but if you would like to help, I'd be glad to work on it
with you with the time I do have.
